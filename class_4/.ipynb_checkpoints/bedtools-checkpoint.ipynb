    "\n",
    "BED files are text files that contain genomic coordinate information, and are typically given the .bed extension. The format of a BED file is specified here: https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1. Only the first three columns are mandatory for bed files, and they contain the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns in a BED file:\n",
    "- Column 1: chromosome\n",
    "- Column 2: start position (the beginning of the first base is indicated by the start position 0; the beginning of the 5th base is indicated by the start position \"4\")\n",
    "- Column 3: end position (the end of the first base is indicated by the end position \"1\"; the end of the 5th base is indicated by the end position \"5\")\n",
    "\n",
    "People are often confused by the fact that the same \"base\" is referred to by a different number depending on whether you are referring to the start or the end. A simple way to understand this is to realize that the positions are not referring to the numbering of the bases themselves, but to the boundary between bases, as illustrated in the figure below:"
