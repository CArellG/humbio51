    "\n",
    "Sequence alignments can also be useful for comparing related genes or proteins within a species. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. These proteins regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis. The evolutionary history of the classical MAP kinases is shown below (*image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26810221*)\n",

    "The growth hormone secretagogue receptor(GHSR), also known as ghrelin receptor, binds hormones such as ghrelin, the \"hunger hormone\". This protein is the receptor for the ghrelin ligand and kicks off a neuroendocrine pathway for growth hormone release.The role of GHSR is thought to be in regulating energy homeostasis and body weight. One transcript, GHSR1a, excises an intron and encodes the functional protein. GHSR1b is a truncated splice variant of GHSR that does not excise this intron and is not able to bind the ghrelin hormone. We will examine the amino acid difference between NM_198407 (the benign splice variant) and NM_004122 (the problematic splice variant i.e. GHSR1b) \n"
