    "\n",
    "The original DNA sequencing methods that were used for the Human Genome Project were called Sanger sequencing and could produce sequences that were >1000 base pairs. These long sequences were very helpful in the construction of the original human reference genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers are still developing technologies to make obtaining long sequencing reads less expensive and to create even longer ranges for the sequncing. \n",
    "\n",
    "These longer reads can help provide information in parts of the genome that have been difficult to sequence. For a recent story of how new technologies for obtaining long sequencing reads is helping in the clinic see [here](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/06/researchers-use-long-read-genome-sequencing-in-a-patient.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the data from most next generation sequencing machines usually produce **short reads** or sequences that are <~200 base pairs [Ref](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n11/full/nbt.2421.html). These are referred to as short-reads. Short-read sequencing is currently less expensive and more common than long-read sequencing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is already a human reference genome, short reads from DNA sequencing experiments can be aligned to the reference genome and can help to define genetic variation in populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see in the next class, short reads from types of DNA sequencing experiments known as RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq experiments can also be aligned to the human reference genome to help define gene expression or gene regulatory regions in different cell types or across different conditions.\n",
