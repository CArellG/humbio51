Your release is named "jhub" and installed into the namespace "jhub".

You can check whether the hub and proxy are ready by running:

 kubectl --namespace=jhub get pod

and watching for both those pods to be in status 'Running'.

You can find the public (load-balancer) IP of JupyterHub by running:

  kubectl -n jhub get svc proxy-public -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}'
# 34.136.149.201

It might take a few minutes for it to appear!

To get full information about the JupyterHub proxy service run:

  kubectl --namespace=jhub get svc proxy-public
